# IBPLFM: Indian Buffet Process for Latent Force Models
By Cristian Guarnizo (cdguarnizo@utpd.edu.co) and Mauricio A. Alvarez (malvarez@utp.edu.co)

## Description
This code uses GPmat framework to calculate covariance functions
from Latent Force Models (LFMs).

By means of the Indian Buffet Process Prior it is posible to automatically
select the number of latent functions required to descried output data.
Additionally, the structure that represents the interconnection between
outputs and latent inputs is learned as well.

The code is based in the following documents:
